But Niels designed the\nactual system based on the constraints.\n\nLater modified by Damien Miller to wrap the LCG output in a 15-bit\npermutation generator based on a Luby-Rackoff block cipher. This\nensures the output is non-repeating and preserves the MSB twiddle\ntrick, but makes it more resistant to LCG prediction.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\nare met:\n1.

You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The license\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n      FreeType code.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">JMake</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"https://github.com/pantsbuild/jmake\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">Khronos header files</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"http://www.khronos.org/registry\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>Copyright (c) 2007-2010 The Khronos Group Inc.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and/or associated documentation files (the\n\"Materials\"), to deal in the Materials without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Materials, and to\npermit persons to whom the Materials are furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Materials.\n\nTHE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nMATERIALS OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE MATERIALS.\n\n\nSGI FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE B (Version 2.0, Sept. 18, 2008)\n\nCopyright (C) 1992 Silicon Graphics, Inc.

For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">LZMA SDK</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>LZMA SDK is placed in the public domain.\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">LeakCanary</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"https://github.com/square/leakcanary\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

However, we discourage people from distributing copies of NSS under\nthe GPL alone, because it means that any improvements they make cannot be\nreincorporated into the main version of NSS. There is never a need to do\nthis for license compatibility reasons.\n\nNote on LGPL Compatibility\n--------------------------\n\nThe above also applies to combining MPLed code in a single library with\ncode under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1, or\nany later version of that license. If the LGPLed code and the MPLed code\nare not in the same library, then the copyleft coverage of the two\nlicences does not overlap, so no issues arise.\n\n\nMozilla Public License Version 2.0\n==================================\n\n1. Definitions\n--------------\n\n1.1. \"Contributor\"\n    means each individual or legal entity that creates, contributes to\n    the creation of, or owns Covered Software.\n\n1.2. \"Contributor Version\"\n    means the combination of the Contributions of others (if any) used\n    by a Contributor and that particular Contributor's Contribution.\n\n1.3. \"Contribution\"\n    means Covered Software of a particular Contributor.\n\n1.4. \"Covered Software\"\n    means Source Code Form to which the initial Contributor has attached\n    the notice in Exhibit A, the Executable Form of such Source Code\n    Form, and Modifications of such Source Code Form, in each case\n    including portions thereof.\n\n1.5. \"Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\"\n    means\n\n    (a) that the initial Contributor has attached the notice described\n        in Exhibit B to the Covered Software; or\n\n    (b) that the Covered Software was made available under the terms of\n        version 1.1 or earlier of the License, but not also under the\n        terms of a Secondary License.\n\n1.6. \"Executable Form\"\n    means any form of the work other than Source Code Form.\n\n1.7. \"Larger Work\"\n    means a work that combines Covered Software with other material, in \n    a separate file or files, that is not Covered Software.\n\n1.8. \"License\"\n    means this document.\n\n1.9. \"Licensable\"\n    means having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible,\n    whether at the time of the initial grant or subsequently, any and\n    all of the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n1.10. \"Modifications\"\n    means any of the following:\n\n    (a) any file in Source Code Form that results from an addition to,\n        deletion from, or modification of the contents of Covered\n        Software; or\n\n    (b) any new file in Source Code Form that contains any Covered\n        Software.\n\n1.11. \"Patent Claims\" of a Contributor\n    means any patent claim(s), including without limitation, method,\n    process, and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by such\n    Contributor that would be infringed, but for the grant of the\n    License, by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having\n    made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its\n    Contributor Version.\n\n1.12. \"Secondary License\"\n    means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, the GNU Affero General\n    Public License, Version 3.0, or any later versions of those\n    licenses.\n\n1.13. \"Source Code Form\"\n    means the form of the work preferred for making modifications.\n\n1.14. \"You\" (or \"Your\")\n    means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this\n    License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that\n    controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You.

Limitations on Grant Scope\n\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\nthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\ndistribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\nLicense (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\npermitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\napplicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\nequivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2.1, February 1999\n\n Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\t51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">Strongtalk</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"http://www.strongtalk.org/\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>Copyright (c) 1994-2006 Sun Microsystems Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n- Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\nthis list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n- Redistribution in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\nnotice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\ndocumentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n- Neither the name of Sun Microsystems or the names of contributors may\nbe used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without\nspecific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Definitions.\n\n      \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\n      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\n      \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\n      the copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\n      \"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\n      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n      \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n      \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity\n      exercising permissions granted by this License.\n\n      \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\n      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\n      source, and configuration files.\n\n      \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\n      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\n      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\n      and conversions to other media types.\n\n      \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\n      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n   2.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

Redistribution.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\nnecessary.

It is\n numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\nother libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\nyour libraries, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nlibrary.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\nthe original authors' reputations.\n\f\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\nsoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\ntransforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\ndesignated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\none; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\n\n  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\nprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\ntreats it as such.\n\n  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\nwill lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\nworks together with the library.\n\n  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\n\f\n                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\nGeneral Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.

Given that the inclusion of a few lines of \"GPL-tainted\" work\ninto a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution -- and\ngiven that further work will likely build upon the \"tainted\" portions,\nmaking them difficult to remove at a future date -- there are inevitable\ncircumstances where authors would, in order to protect their goal of\nproviding for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against\nsuch \"GPL-taint\".\n\nIn addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and\nselling (possibly closed-source) code would wish to protect themselves\nagainst the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.

Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details. Some other\nfiles have MIT/X11/BSD-style licenses. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to\nFFmpeg.\n\nSome optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License\nversion 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details. None of\nthese parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to\nconfigure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.\n\nSpecifically, the GPL parts of FFmpeg are:\n\n- libpostproc\n- optional x86 optimizations in the files\n  - `libavcodec/x86/flac_dsp_gpl.asm`\n  - `libavcodec/x86/idct_mmx.c`\n  - `libavfilter/x86/vf_removegrain.asm`\n- libutvideo encoding/decoding wrappers in\n  `libavcodec/libutvideo*.cpp`\n- the X11 grabber in `libavdevice/x11grab.c`\n- the swresample test app in\n  `libswresample/swresample-test.c`\n- the `texi2pod.pl` tool\n- the following filters in libavfilter:\n    - `f_ebur128.c`\n    - `vf_blackframe.c`\n    - `vf_boxblur.c`\n    - `vf_colormatrix.c`\n    - `vf_cover_rect.c`\n    - `vf_cropdetect.c`\n    - `vf_delogo.c`\n    - `vf_eq.c`\n    - `vf_find_rect.c`\n    - `vf_fspp.c`\n    - `vf_geq.c`\n    - `vf_histeq.c`\n    - `vf_hqdn3d.c`\n    - `vf_interlace.c`\n    - `vf_kerndeint.c`\n    - `vf_mcdeint.c`\n    - `vf_mpdecimate.c`\n    - `vf_owdenoise.c`\n    - `vf_perspective.c`\n    - `vf_phase.c`\n    - `vf_pp.c`\n    - `vf_pp7.c`\n    - `vf_pullup.c`\n    - `vf_sab.c`\n    - `vf_smartblur.c`\n    - `vf_repeatfields.c`\n    - `vf_spp.c`\n    - `vf_stereo3d.c`\n    - `vf_super2xsai.c`\n    - `vf_tinterlace.c`\n    - `vf_uspp.c`\n    - `vsrc_mptestsrc.c`\n\nShould you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the (L)GPL, then\nthe configure parameter `--enable-version3` will activate this licensing option\nfor you. Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv3` or, if you have enabled GPL parts,\n`COPYING.GPLv3` to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.\n\nThere are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:\n\n* The files `libavcodec/jfdctfst.c`, `libavcodec/jfdctint_template.c` and\n  `libavcodec/jrevdct.c` are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for\n  licensing details. Specifically note that you must credit the IJG in the\n  documentation accompanying your program if you only distribute executables.\n  You must also indicate any changes including additions and deletions to\n  those three files in the documentation.\n* `tests/reference.pnm` is under the expat license.\n\n\nexternal libraries\n==================\n\nFFmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes\naffect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.\n\ncompatible libraries\n--------------------\n\nThe following libraries are under GPL:\n- frei0r\n- libcdio\n- librubberband\n- libutvideo\n- libvidstab\n- libx264\n- libx265\n- libxavs\n- libxvid\n\nWhen combining them with FFmpeg, FFmpeg needs to be licensed as GPL as well by\npassing `--enable-gpl` to configure.\n\nThe OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License 2.0. That\nlicense is incompatible with the LGPL v2.1 and the GPL v2, but not with\nversion 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with FFmpeg, the\nlicense version needs to be upgraded by passing `--enable-version3` to configure.\n\nincompatible libraries\n----------------------\n\nThe Fraunhofer AAC library and FAAC are under licenses which\nare incompatible with the GPLv2 and v3. We do not know for certain if their\nlicenses are compatible with the LGPL.\nIf you wish to enable these libraries, pass `--enable-nonfree` to configure.\nBut note that if you enable any of these libraries the resulting binary will\nbe under a complex license mix that is more restrictive than the LGPL and that\nmay result in additional obligations. It is possible that these\nrestrictions cause the resulting binary to be unredistributeable.\n\n\n********************************************************************************\n\nlibavcodec/arm/vp8dsp_armv6.S\n\nVP8 ARMv6 optimisations\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 Google Inc.\nCopyright (c) 2010 Rob Clark &lt;rob@ti.com&gt;\nCopyright (c) 2011 Mans Rullgard &lt;mans@mansr.com&gt;\n\nThis file is part of FFmpeg.\n\nFFmpeg is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nFFmpeg is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\n  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">fips181</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"http://www.adel.nursat.kz/apg/\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>Copyright (c) 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002\nAdel I.

Definitions.\n\n      \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\n      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\n      \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\n      the copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\n      \"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\n      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n      \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n      \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity\n      exercising permissions granted by this License.\n\n      \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\n      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\n      source, and configuration files.\n\n      \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\n      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\n      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\n      and conversions to other media types.\n\n      \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\n      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner.

Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Time Zone Database\n\n   ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database\n   for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained\n   in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.\n\n7.  Database Ownership\n\n   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n   document.

Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply\n   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.\n   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,\n   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in\n   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,\n   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court\n   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust\n   on the database or the code.

However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part\nof any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than\nthe foregoing paragraphs do.\n\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf.\nIt is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.\nThe same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,\nltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright\nby M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\n\nIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by\npatents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot\nlegally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,\nsupport for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\n(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented\nHuffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)\nSo far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining\ncode.\n\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\nTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has\nbeen removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce\n\"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the\nresulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard\nGIF decoders.\n\nWe are required to state that\n    \"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of\n    CompuServe Incorporated.

If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,\n    then:\n\n    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices\n        from the source.\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 1 of the IJG License\n        - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License\n        - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License\n\n    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source\n        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if\n        there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can\n        simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 1 of the IJG License\n        - Clause 2 of the zlib License\n\n    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the\n        copyright or license text in that file.\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 1 of the IJG License\n\n2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or\n    if you are distributing an application that statically links with\n    libjpeg-turbo, then:\n\n    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:\n\n        This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG\n        Group.\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 2 of the IJG license\n\n    2.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n\t\t  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

It is\n numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\nother libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\nyour libraries, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nlibrary.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\nthe original authors' reputations.\n\f\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\nsoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\ntransforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\ndesignated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\none; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\n\n  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\nprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\ntreats it as such.\n\n  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\nwill lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\nworks together with the library.\n\n  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\n\f\n\t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\nGeneral Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

See the file\nCOPYING.NEWLIB for details.  The rest of the release tree is under either\nthe GNU GPL or LGPL licenses.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n\nUnpacking and Installation -- quick overview\n==========================\n\nWhen you unpack the newlib-2.0.0.tar.gz file, you'll find a directory\ncalled `newlib-2.0.0', which contains:\n\nCOPYING          config/          install-sh*      mpw-configure\nCOPYING.LIB      config-ml.in     libgloss/        mpw-install\nCOPYING.NEWLIB   config.guess*    mkinstalldirs*   newlib/\nCYGNUS           config.sub*      move-if-change*  symlink-tree*\nChangeLog        configure*       mpw-README       texinfo/\nMakefile.in      configure.in     mpw-build.in\nREADME           etc/             mpw-config.in\n\nTo build NEWLIB, you must follow the instructions in the section entitled\n\"Compiling NEWLIB\".\n\nThis will configure and build all the libraries and crt0 (if one exists).\nIf `configure' can't determine your host system type, specify one as its\nargument, e.g., sun4 or sun4sol2.  NEWLIB is most often used in cross\nenvironments.\n\nNOTE THAT YOU MUST HAVE ALREADY BUILT AND INSTALLED GCC and BINUTILS.\n\n\nMore Documentation\n==================\n\n   Newlib documentation is available on the net via:\n   http://sourceware.org/newlib/docs.html\n\n   All the documentation for NEWLIB comes as part of the machine-readable\ndistribution.  The documentation is written in Texinfo format, which is\na documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both\non-line information and a printed manual.  You can use one of the Info\nformatting commands to create the on-line version of the documentation\nand TeX (or `texi2roff') to typeset the printed version.\n\n   If you want to format these Info files yourself, you need one of the\nInfo formatting programs, such as `texinfo-format-buffer' or `makeinfo'.\n\n   If you want to typeset and print copies of this manual, you need TeX,\na program to print its DVI output files, and `texinfo.tex', the Texinfo\ndefinitions file.\n\n   TeX is a typesetting program; it does not print files directly, but\nproduces output files called DVI files.  To print a typeset document,\nyou need a program to print DVI files.  If your system has TeX\ninstalled, chances are it has such a program.  The precise command to\nuse depends on your system; `lpr -d' is common; another (for PostScript\ndevices) is `dvips'.  The DVI print command may require a file name\nwithout any extension or a `.dvi' extension.\n\n   TeX also requires a macro definitions file called `texinfo.tex'. \nThis file tells TeX how to typeset a document written in Texinfo\nformat.  On its own, TeX cannot read, much less typeset a Texinfo file.\n`texinfo.tex' is distributed with NEWLIB and is located in the\n`newlib-VERSION-NUMBER/texinfo' directory.\n\n\n\nCompiling NEWLIB\n================\n\n   To compile NEWLIB, you must build it in a directory separate from\nthe source directory.  If you want to run NEWLIB versions for several host \nor target machines, you need a different `newlib' compiled for each combination\nof host and target.  `configure' is designed to make this easy by allowing \nyou to generate each configuration in a separate subdirectory.\nIf your `make' program handles the `VPATH' feature correctly (like GNU `make')\nrunning `make' in each of these directories builds the `newlib' libraries\nspecified there.\n\n   To build `newlib' in a specific directory, run `configure' with the\n`--srcdir' option to specify where to find the source. (You also need\nto specify a path to find `configure' itself from your working\ndirectory.  If the path to `configure' would be the same as the\nargument to `--srcdir', you can leave out the `--srcdir' option; it\nwill be assumed.)\n\n   For example, with version 2.0.0, you can build NEWLIB in a separate\ndirectory for a Sun 4 cross m68k-aout environment like this:\n\n     cd newlib-2.0.0\n     mkdir ../newlib-m68k-aout\n     cd ../newlib-m68k-aout\n     ../newlib-2.0.0/configure --host=sun4 --target=m68k-aout\n     make\n\n   When `configure' builds a configuration using a remote source\ndirectory, it creates a tree for the binaries with the same structure\n(and using the same names) as the tree under the source directory.  In\nthe example, you'd find the Sun 4 library `libiberty.a' in the\ndirectory `newlib-m68k-aout/libiberty', and NEWLIB itself in\n`newlib-m68k-aout/newlib'.\n\n   When you run `make' to build a program or library, you must run it\nin a configured directory--whatever directory you were in when you\ncalled `configure' (or one of its subdirectories).\n\n   The `Makefile' that `configure' generates in each source directory\nalso runs recursively.  If you type `make' in a source directory such\nas `newlib-2.0.0' (or in a separate configured directory configured with\n`--srcdir=PATH/newlib-2.0.0'), you will build all the required libraries.\n\n   When you have multiple hosts or targets configured in separate\ndirectories, you can run `make' on them in parallel (for example, if\nthey are NFS-mounted on each of the hosts); they will not interfere\nwith each other.\n\n\nSpecifying names for hosts and targets\n======================================\n\n   The specifications used for hosts and targets in the `configure'\nscript are based on a three-part naming scheme, but some short\npredefined aliases are also supported.  The full naming scheme encodes\nthree pieces of information in the following pattern:\n\n     ARCHITECTURE-VENDOR-OS\n\n   For example, you can use the alias `sun4' as a HOST argument or in a\n`--target=TARGET' option.  The equivalent full name is\n`sparc-sun-sunos4'.\n\n   The `configure' script accompanying NEWLIB does not provide any query\nfacility to list all supported host and target names or aliases. \n`configure' calls the Bourne shell script `config.sub' to map\nabbreviations to full names; you can read the script, if you wish, or\nyou can use it to test your guesses on abbreviations--for example:\n\n     % sh config.sub sun4\n     sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1\n     % sh config.sub sun3\n     m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1\n     % sh config.sub decstation\n     mips-dec-ultrix4.2\n     % sh config.sub hp300bsd\n     m68k-hp-bsd\n     % sh config.sub i386v\n     i386-pc-sysv\n     % sh config.sub i786v\n     Invalid configuration `i786v': machine `i786v' not recognized\n\nThe Build, Host and Target Concepts in newlib\n=============================================\n\nThe build, host and target concepts are defined for gcc as follows:\n\nbuild: the platform on which gcc is built.\nhost: the platform on which gcc is run.\ntarget: the platform for which gcc generates code.\n\nSince newlib is a library, the target concept does not apply to it, and the\nbuild, host, and target options given to the top-level configure script must\nbe changed for newlib's use.\n\nThe options are shifted according to these correspondences:\n\ngcc's build platform has no equivalent in newlib.\ngcc's host platform is newlib's build platform.\ngcc's target platform is newlib's host platform.\nand as mentioned before, newlib has no concept of target.\n\n`configure' options\n===================\n\n   Here is a summary of the `configure' options and arguments that are\nmost often useful for building NEWLIB.  `configure' also has several other\noptions not listed here.\n\n     configure [--help]\n               [--prefix=DIR]\n               [--srcdir=PATH]\n               [--target=TARGET] HOST\n\nYou may introduce options with a single `-' rather than `--' if you\nprefer; but you may abbreviate option names if you use `--'.\n\n`--help'\n     Display a quick summary of how to invoke `configure'.\n\n`--prefix=DIR'\n     Configure the source to install programs and files in directory\n     `DIR'.\n\n`--exec-prefix=DIR'\n     Configure the source to install host-dependent files in directory\n     `DIR'.\n\n`--srcdir=PATH'\n     *Warning: using this option requires GNU `make', or another `make'\n     that compatibly implements the `VPATH' feature.\n     Use this option to make configurations in directories separate\n     from the NEWLIB source directories.  Among other things, you can use\n     this to build (or maintain) several configurations simultaneously,\n     in separate directories.  `configure' writes configuration\n     specific files in the current directory, but arranges for them to\n     use the source in the directory PATH.  `configure' will create\n     directories under the working directory in parallel to the source\n     directories below PATH.\n\n`--norecursion'\n     Configure only the directory level where `configure' is executed;\n     do not propagate configuration to subdirectories.\n\n`--target=TARGET'\n     Configure NEWLIB for running on the specified TARGET.\n\n     There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available\n     targets.\n\n`HOST ...'\n     Configure NEWLIB to be built using a cross compiler running on\n     the specified HOST.\n\n     There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available\n     hosts.\n\nTo fit diverse usage models, NEWLIB supports a group of configuration\noptions so that library features can be turned on/off according to\ntarget system's requirements.\n\nOne feature can be enabled by specifying `--enable-FEATURE=yes' or\n`--enable-FEATURE'.  Or it can be disable by `--enable-FEATURE=no' or\n`--disable-FEATURE'.\n\n`--enable-newlib-io-pos-args'\n     Enable printf-family positional arg support.\n     Disabled by default, but some hosts enable it in configure.host.\n\n`--enable-newlib-io-c99-formats'\n     Enable C99 support in IO functions like printf/scanf.\n     Disabled by default, but some hosts enable it in configure.host.\n\n`--enable-newlib-register-fini'\n     Enable finalization function registration using atexit.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-io-long-long'\n     Enable long long type support in IO functions like printf/scanf.\n     Disabled by default, but many hosts enable it in configure.host.\n\n`--enable-newlib-io-long-double'\n     Enable long double type support in IO functions printf/scanf.\n     Disabled by default, but some hosts enable it in configure.host.\n\n`--enable-newlib-mb'\n     Enable multibyte support.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-iconv-encodings'\n     Enable specific comma-separated list of bidirectional iconv\n     encodings to be built-in.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-iconv-from-encodings'\n     Enable specific comma-separated list of \\\"from\\\" iconv encodings\n     to be built-in.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-iconv-to-encodings'\n     Enable specific comma-separated list of \\\"to\\\" iconv encodings\n     to be built-in.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-iconv-external-ccs'\n     Enable capabilities to load external CCS files for iconv.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--disable-newlib-atexit-dynamic-alloc'\n     Disable dynamic allocation of atexit entries.\n     Most hosts and targets have it enabled in configure.host.\n\n`--enable-newlib-reent-small'\n     Enable small reentrant struct support.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--disable-newlib-fvwrite-in-streamio'\n     NEWLIB implements the vector buffer mechanism to support stream IO\n     buffering required by C standard.  This feature is possibly\n     unnecessary for embedded systems which won't change file buffering\n     with functions like `setbuf' or `setvbuf'.  The buffering mechanism\n     still acts as default for STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR even if this option\n     is specified.\n     Enabled by default.\n\n`--disable-newlib-fseek-optimization'\n     Disable fseek optimization.  It can decrease code size of application\n     calling `fseek`.\n     Enabled by default.\n\n`--disable-newlib-wide-orient'\n     C99 states that each stream has an orientation, wide or byte.  This\n     feature is possibly unnecessary for embedded systems which only do\n     byte input/output operations on stream.  It can decrease code size\n     by disable the feature.\n     Enabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-nano-malloc'\n     NEWLIB has two implementations of malloc family's functions, one in\n     `mallocr.c' and the other one in `nano-mallocr.c'.  This options\n     enables the nano-malloc implementation, which is for small systems\n     with very limited memory.  Note that this implementation does not\n     support `--enable-malloc-debugging' any more.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--disable-newlib-unbuf-stream-opt'\n     NEWLIB does optimization when `fprintf to write only unbuffered unix\n     file'.  It creates a temorary buffer to do the optimization that\n     increases stack consumption by about `BUFSIZ' bytes.  This option\n     disables the optimization and saves size of text and stack.\n     Enabled by default.\n\n`--enable-multilib'\n     Build many library versions.\n     Enabled by default.\n\n`--enable-target-optspace'\n     Optimize for space.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--enable-malloc-debugging'\n     Indicate malloc debugging requested.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-multithread'\n     Enable support for multiple threads.\n     Enabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-iconv'\n     Enable iconv library support.\n     Disabled by default.\n\n`--enable-newlib-elix-level'\n     Supply desired elix library level (1-4).  Please refer to HOWTO for\n     more information about this option.\n     Set to level 0 by default.\n\n`--disable-newlib-io-float'\n     Disable printf/scanf family float support.\n     Enabled by default.\n\n`--disable-newlib-supplied-syscalls'\n     Disable newlib from supplying syscalls.\n     Enabled by default.\n\n`--enable-lite-exit'\n     Enable lite exit, a size-reduced implementation of exit that doesn't\n     invoke clean-up functions such as _fini or global destructors.\n     Disabled by default.\n\nRunning the Testsuite\n=====================\n\nTo run newlib's testsuite, you'll need a site.exp in your home\ndirectory which points dejagnu to the proper baseboards directory and\nthe proper exp file for your target.\n\nBefore running make check-target-newlib, set the DEJAGNU environment\nvariable to point to ~/site.exp.\n\nHere is a sample site.exp:\n\n# Make sure we look in the right place for the board description files.\nif ![info exists boards_dir] {\n    set boards_dir {}\n}\nlappend boards_dir \"your dejagnu/baseboards here\"\n\nverbose \"Global Config File: target_triplet is $target_triplet\" 2\n\nglobal target_list\ncase \"$target_triplet\" in {\n\n    { \"mips-*elf*\" } {\n\tset target_list \"mips-sim\"\n    }\n\n    default {\n\tset target_list { \"unix\" }\n    }\n}\n\nmips-sim refers to an exp file in the baseboards directory.  You'll\nneed to add the other targets you're testing to the case statement.\n\nNow type make check-target-newlib in the top-level build directory to\nrun the testsuite.\n\nShared newlib\n=============\n\nnewlib uses libtool when it is being compiled natively (with\n--target=i[34567]86-pc-linux-gnu) on an i[34567]86-pc-linux-gnu\nhost. This allows newlib to be compiled as a shared library.\n\nTo configure newlib, do the following from your build directory:\n\n$(source_dir)/src/configure --with-newlib --prefix=$(install_dir)\n\nconfigure will recognize that host == target ==\ni[34567]86-pc-linux-gnu, so it will tell newlib to compile itself using\nlibtool. By default, libtool will build shared and static versions of\nnewlib.\n\nTo compile a program against shared newlib, do the following (where\ntarget_install_dir = $(install_dir)/i[34567]86-pc-linux-gnu):\n\ngcc -nostdlib $(target_install_dir)/lib/crt0.o progname.c -I $(target_install_dir)/include -L $(target_install_dir)/lib -lc -lm -lgcc\n\nTo run the program, make sure that $(target_install_dir)/lib is listed\nin the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.\n\nTo create a static binary linked against newlib, do the following:\n\ngcc -nostdlib -static $(target_install_dir)/lib/crt0.o progname.c -I $(target_install_dir)/include -L $(target_install_dir)/lib -lc -lm\n\nlibtool can be instructed to produce only static libraries. To build\nnewlib as a static library only, do the following from your build\ndirectory:\n\n$(source_dir)/src/configure --with-newlib --prefix=$(install_dir) --disable-shared\n\nRegenerating Configuration Files\n================================\n\nAt times you will need to make changes to configure.in and Makefile.am files.\nThis will mean that configure and Makefile.in files will need to be\nregenerated.\n\nAt the top level of newlib is the file: acinclude.m4.  This file contains\nthe definition of the NEWLIB_CONFIGURE macro which is used by all configure.in\nfiles in newlib.  You will notice that each directory in newlib containing\na configure.in file also contains an aclocal.m4 file.  This file is\ngenerated by issuing: aclocal -I${relative_path_to_toplevel_newlib_dir}\n-I${relative_path_to_toplevel_src_dir}\nThe first relative directory is to access acinclude.m4.  The second relative\ndirectory is to access libtool information in the top-level src directory.\n\nFor example, to regenerate aclocal.m4 in newlib/libc/machine/arm:\n\n  aclocal -I ../../.. -I ../../../..\n\nNote that if the top level acinclude.m4 is altered, every aclocal.m4 file \nin newlib should be regenerated.\n\nIf the aclocal.m4 file is regenerated due to a change in acinclude.m4 or\nif a configure.in file is modified, the corresponding configure file in the \ndirectory must be regenerated using autoconf.  No parameters are necessary.\nIn the previous example, we would issue:\n\n  autoconf\n\nfrom the newlib/libc/machine/arm directory.\n\nIf you have regenerated a configure file or if you have modified a Makefile.am\nfile, you will need to regenerate the appropriate Makefile.in file(s).\nFor newlib, automake is a bit trickier.  First of all, all Makefile.in\nfiles in newlib (and libgloss) are generated using the --cygnus option\nof automake.  \n\nMakefile.in files are generated from the nearest directory up the chain\nwhich contains a configure.in file.  In most cases, this is the same\ndirectory containing configure.in, but there are exceptions.\nFor example, the newlib/libc directory has a number of\nsubdirectories that do not contain their own configure.in files (e.g. stdio).\nFor these directories, you must issue the automake command from newlib/libc\nwhich is the nearest parent directory that contains a configure.in.\nWhen you issue the automake command, you specify the subdirectory for\nthe Makefile.in you are regenerating.  For example:\n\n   automake --cygnus stdio/Makefile stdlib/Makefile\n\nNote how multiple Makefile.in files can be created in the same step.  You\nwould not specify machine/Makefile or sys/Makefile in the previous example\nbecause both of these subdirectories contain their own configure.in files.\nOne would change to each of these subdirectories and in turn issue:\n\n   automake --cygnus Makefile\n\nLet's say you create a new machine directory XXXX off of newlib/libc/machine.\nAfter creating a new configure.in and Makefile.am file, you would issue:\n\n   aclocal -I ../../..\n   autoconf\n   automake --cygnus Makefile\n\nfrom newlib/libc/machine/XXXX\n\nIt is strongly advised that you use an adequate version of autotools.\nFor this latest release, the following were used: autoconf 2.68, aclocal 1.11.6, and \nautomake 1.11.6.\n\nReporting Bugs\n==============\n\nThe correct address for reporting bugs found in NEWLIB is\n\"newlib@sourceware.org\".  Please email all bug reports to that\naddress.  Please include the NEWLIB version number (e.g., newlib-2.0.0),\nand how you configured it (e.g., \"sun4 host and m68k-aout target\").\nSince NEWLIB supports many different configurations, it is important\nthat you be precise about this.\n\nArchives of the newlib mailing list are on-line, see\n\thttp://sourceware.org/ml/newlib/\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">ocmock</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>  \n  Copyright (c) 2004-2012 by Mulle Kybernetik.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301 USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">re2 - an efficient, principled regular expression library</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"https://github.com/google/re2\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>// Copyright (c) 2009 The RE2 Authors.

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner.

Redistribution.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n^L\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n^L\n\t\t  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n^L\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n^L\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n^L\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n^L\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n^L\n  14.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n^L\n\t   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"product\">\n<span class=\"title\">valgrind</span>\n<a class=\"show\" href=\"#\">show license</a>\n<span class=\"homepage\"><a href=\"http://valgrind.org\">homepage</a></span>\n<div class=\"licence\">\n<pre>   Notice that the following BSD-style license applies to the Valgrind header\n   files used by Chromium (valgrind.h and memcheck.h).

If You distribute copies of the Original Work or\na Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to\nobtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing\nelse but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\ngrants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\nor to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\nto do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\nbetween Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\nequivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\nYour acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\n\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\nas of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\nfor patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a patent\napplicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent\napplicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the Original\nWork with other software or hardware).\n\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\nscope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101 et seq.,\nthe equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section\nshall survive the termination of this License.\n\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\nLicense.\n\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\nthe subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\nmake it enforceable.\n\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether\nin upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\nunder, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\nentities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\nunder common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\n(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\nentity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\n(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\nentity.\n\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\nrestricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\nto interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n\nThis license is Copyright (C) 2003 Lawrence E.
